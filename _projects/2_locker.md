Locker is an oblivious datastore system that protects data access patterns from potential adversaries. The system uses advanced cryptographic techniques to ensure that even an adversary with full visibility into the system's operations cannot determine which data is being accessed.

## Key Features

- **Oblivious Access Patterns**: Hides data access patterns from observers
- **Cryptographic Security**: Uses state-of-the-art cryptographic primitives
- **Performance Optimization**: Balances security with practical performance
- **Privacy Protection**: Ensures data privacy even under adversarial conditions

## Impact

In an era where data privacy is paramount, Locker provides a crucial layer of protection for sensitive data access patterns. This is particularly important for systems handling confidential information where access patterns themselves could reveal sensitive information.
