Hello! I'm Sallar Farokhi, a researcher and developer passionate about exploring innovative solutions in distributed systems, security, and data analytics.

My work focuses on building scalable and secure systems that can handle complex computational challenges. I'm particularly interested in:

- **Distributed Systems**: Designing and implementing systems that can efficiently manage workloads across multiple nodes
- **Security**: Developing techniques to protect data access patterns and ensure system security
- **Data Analytics**: Creating high-performance stream processing systems for real-time analysis
- **Cloud Computing**: Optimizing resource allocation and workload placement, including carbon-aware scheduling

Through my research projects, I've worked on carbon-aware Kubernetes schedulers, oblivious datastores for protecting data access patterns, content moderation systems, safety-aligned dataset engines, and high-performance stream processing frameworks.

Feel free to explore my projects and research papers, and don't hesitate to reach out if you'd like to collaborate or discuss any of my work!
